# ðŸ’ª Installation ðŸ’ª

First create a slack app by following these instructions:

  * [Slack App Basics](https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics)

Ensure you have a Slack authentication token, channel name, and Ko-fi creator name. You will need to grant this bot the `chat:write` privilege scope.

This bot comes with a install script that will start a cronjob as the user of your choice to check for updates once an hour.

## ðŸ¤– Automated Script Install ðŸ¤–

This setup script can be run on the hosting provider of your choice using the following command:

```
sudo wget -qO- https://github.com/Maxfield-Chen/kofi-slack-bot/releases/download/v1.0/install.sh | bash
```

The configuration for this bot will be performed for you during the setup script run, but may also be performed by setting the following environment variables:

```
"SLACK_BOT_USER": kofi user (name, not URL).
"SLACK_BOT_TOKEN": Slack Authorization Token
"SLACK_BOT_CHANNEL": Controls which channel the bot posts to
```

## ðŸš— Usage ðŸš—

Add your bot to the desired slack channel. When writing updates in Ko-fi make sure to use the "Blog Post" option, since those are the posts that are currently supported.
